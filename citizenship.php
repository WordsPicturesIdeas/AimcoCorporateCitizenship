							<h1>Meeting Community Needs</h1>
							<p>
								From Miami to Los Angeles, the Aimco team welcomes opportunities to contribute to the success of local initiatives that support economic development and community well-being. In Miami Beach, Aimco demonstrated its support for the City’s goal of providing a public promenade to showcase the beauty of Biscayne Bay. Aimco stepped forward to construct a 1/3 mile section of the Baywalk, adjacent to the Flamingo South Beach Apartments. The new section provides citizens with greater connectivity around the Bay and offers Aimco residents access to nearby South Beach amenities and services.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Los Angeles, Aimco continues its strong partnership with area business leaders and elected officials through its involvement in the Los Angeles Business Council. Aimco serves annually as a sponsor of the Mayor’s Housing, Transportation and Jobs Summit. The company also presents the annual Aimco Housing Impact Award, this year given to California Secretary of Housing and Community Development Anna Caballero in honor of her role in promoting housing and economic sustainability.

							<h1>Aimco Cares</h1>

								Aimco lives its value of giving back through its philanthropic program, Aimco Cares. Every Aimco team member receives 10 paid hours of time each year to volunteer in the community. Aimco Cares teams across the country get involved in a broad spectrum of projects to benefit local non-profits. Whether building trails in a local park, serving meals at a shelter, working at a local food bank, or uplifting the spirits of children undergoing medical treatment, team members give of themselves in ways meaningful to them while improving communities. During two, team-designated, national weeks of community service and throughout 2013, team members participated in 133 separate Aimco Cares events.

					   	In 2013, Aimco delivered solid results for our residents, shareholders, team members, and community partners. By managing a portfolio that increased in value each quarter, introducing innovative approaches to improved customer service, fostering a company culture that promotes collaboration, and redeveloping properties that promote economic development in communities across the country, Aimco made significant strides toward meeting our goal of being the nation’s best owner and operator of apartment communities.
					   </p>
					   <p>
							We have continued our strategy of improving Aimco's portfolio with high quality and distinctive apartment communities concentrated in superior locations.
					   </p>
						<p>
							A key component of Aimco’s plan to add value is a robust redevelopment program. In 2013, Aimco was joined by community partners, business leaders, and elected officials to celebrate redevelopment projects in Miami Beach, San Mateo, CA, Venice, CA, and Chicago, and to break ground on new construction in Boston. Our efforts have been bolstered by the strong alliances formed with community partners who work with us on an ongoing basis to meet housing needs, create jobs, and stimulate economic development.
						</p>
						<p>
							The cornerstone of our success is not only meeting, but exceeding the needs of our customers. Aimco residents can expect to live in an environment that is well-cared for and responsive to their lifestyles.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="span4">
						<p>
							As our mission states, our team strives to consistently provide quality apartment homes in a respectful environment delivered by a team of people who care. We have implemented convenient and time-saving self-service options for residents. Residents also enjoy amenities designed to support their active, healthy lifestyles such as smoke-free living, state-of-the-art fitness centers, pet-friendly environments, and ample outdoor gathering and recreation spaces. Our customers have a clear voice in how Aimco conducts business: thousands of satisfaction surveys are collected throughout the year to help us determine how best to meet resident needs.
						</p>

						<p>
							Whether serving customers, making the day-to-day operations run smoothly, or proposing innovative ideas to move the company forward, Aimco’s team members are the heart of our business. The team embraces our company’s culture, which encourages a healthy work/life balance, accountability, collaboration, innovation, and outstanding service. The collegial spirit that exists at Aimco has helped us earn the designation of a 2013 Top Workplace in the state of Colorado, as recognized by the Denver Post.
						</p>

						<p>
							Some of the most meaningful team collaborations within Aimco stem from our philanthropic program, Aimco Cares. The Aimco Cares national volunteer program addresses local needs through hundreds of service projects across the country where team members give of themselves to improve the quality of life for their neighbors and communities. 
						</p>
					

					</div>

					<div class="span4">

						<p>
							Aimco Cares also partners with community non-profits to raise money for exceptional causes focusing on military families, children, and education.
						</p>

						<p>
							Our strong record of accomplishment on all fronts would not be possible without a solid foundation of corporate governance, ethics and integrity exemplified by every team member and, especially, the Aimco Board of Directors. 
						</p>

						<p>
							The outstanding leadership and commitment of our directors sets an example for the team and it is a privilege to work with them to oversee the Aimco business. Together, we have increased value for our shareholders, with an annualized 8 percent increase in the dividend.
						</p>

						<p>
							This has been a year of delivering steady results, executing on our plans and honoring our commitment to outstanding corporate citizenship. As you read through this year’s report, I hope you agree that we have truly brought our vision home.
